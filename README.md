This project was our main project for the course Prototyping Interactive Systems at IIITD Monsoon 2019.

Our project addresses all your sleep related problems.
It has an inbuilt alarm system which you can't get rid off until you're awake and not on your bed anymore. It allows you to set an alarm at night before you sleep. 
At the required time of the alarm, a vibration is produced on the pillow. If you don't wake up till another minute, the lights of the room automatically switch on 
and the sound of the alarm increases which switches off only when you're not on your bed anymore.
It also has a sleep detecting system. According to psychology, the more you move in your sleep, the more you're subconsciously awake and the more your sleep is disturbed.
That's why our smart bed checks the movement of the person sleeping for the entire night and gives an approximate idea of how deep his/her sleep is every morning.
Our smart bed has a screen attached which displays this information every morning.
