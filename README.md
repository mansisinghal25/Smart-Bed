This project was our main project for the course Prototyping Interactive Systems at IIITD Monsoon 2019.

Our project addresses all your sleep related problems. <br />
Our smart bed has an inbuilt alarm system which detects whether you are up or not and accordingly turns on the lights of your room, creating an environment in which it is not possible for you to sleep and thereby making sure that you wake up on time. <br />

It also has a sleep detecting system. <br />
According to psychology, the more you move in your sleep, the more you're subconsciously awake and the more your sleep is disturbed. That's why our smart bed checks the movement of the person sleeping for the entire night and gives an approximate idea of how deep his/her sleep is every morning. It has a screen attached which displays this information every morning.
